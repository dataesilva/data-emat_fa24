They devised a scheme to recharge their ship\\'s energy cells using the electrical energy of Korbal\\'s lightning beasts.

Garth had hoped to make some money to look for his brother, but quit the team soon after due to McCauley\\'s lack of morals. Despite aiding the Legion against Daxamite terrorists, Garth was still not allowed to rejoin, so he went off again to find his brother. When he found Mekt, his mind had snapped, and he was a deadly criminal. Mekt abducted Garth and shot his right arm off. After recovering from his battle with Mekt and gaining a cybernetic arm, Garth worked with a newly formed Espionage Squad to uncover the corruption of <a href=\"/president-chu/4005-21136/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21136\">President Chu</a>. She was impeached, and Brande was made president in her place.

They were now a teen youth movement and Garth coined their first battle cry: \"Eat it, Grandpa!\" He was dating Saturn Girl, and said that the only way to successfully date a telepath was to be \"way honest.\" He was instrumental in gaining legal status for the Legion, but forgot to read the fine print in the agreement - the U.P. now had the right to use the Legion\\'s image in any way they wished. When Cosmic Boy disappeared after the Dominators attempted to take over Earth, a public election was held for Legion leadership. <a href=\"/supergirl/4005-2351/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2351\">Supergirl</a> was elected with Lightning Lad her deputy. She soon left for the 21st century and Garth became the team leader. Garth was quickly overwhelmed with the responsibilities of leadership, especially dealing with the various organizations of the United Planets. This put a strain in he and Saturn Girl\\'s relationship which led her to have a psychic affair. She confessed the indiscretion and Garth broke up with her.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1093603\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4466257668712\" data-width=\"815\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 815px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1093603\"><img alt=\"Lightning Lad (New Earth)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg 815w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Lightning Lad (New Earth)\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg 815w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lightning Lad (New Earth)</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/infinite-crisis/4045-40765/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40765\">Infinite Crisis</a> restored the original Legion continuity from before Five Years Later.

Proty\\'s consciousness had been transferred into Garth\\'s body and was the cause of Lightning Lad\\'s resurrection. Being a former telepath as Proty, Garth was able to protect his thoughts from his telepathic wife about the matter. Garth assisted Legionnaires past and present in hunting down <a href=\"../../glorith/29-26385/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Glorith</a> and <a href=\"../../mordru/29-4904/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mordru</a> to save Cosmic Boy. <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Zero Hour</a> then happened and Garth and the other Legionnaires sacrificed themselves to save the timestream and create a new reality.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><h4>The Death of Garth</h4><p>When half the Legion was stuck in the 20th century, Brande personally asked Garth to become Legion leader. Live Wire wasn\\'t comfortable with the idea and shortly thereafter hosted a leadership election for a replacement. Once the team was reunited, he began a relationship with Saturn Girl and ultimately proposed. Garth and Imra were one of several Legionnaires lost in a spatial rift. Saturn Girl\\'s manipulation of the team put a strain on their relationship. Live Wire sacrificed himself fighting their former teammate, <a href=\"../../element-lad/29-1263/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Element Lad</a>, who had spent billions of years becoming a mad god.</p><h4>Garth\\'s Body Restored</h4><p>Garth\\'s spirit, however, was stored in the living crystals of <a href=\"../../element-lad/29-1263/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Element Lad</a>\\'s corpse, and he was able to return to the Legion - but in Element Lad\\'s body. This caused a lot of anxiety among the Legion, but eventually his friends came to accept Garth. When Earth-247 was destroyed in <a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Infinite Crisis</a>, Garth and his team survived because they had been lost in the timestream. Garth\\'s original body was eventually restored when the <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Brainiac 5</a> of New Earth used a special lightning rod to help Garth transmute himself to normal. He then rejoined his team as they pushed into the <a href=\"../../dc-multiverse/12-43603/\" rel=\"nofollow \">multiverse</a> as the new <a href=\"../../wanderers/65-47418/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Wanderers</a>.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h3>Electricity Control</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-506307\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.3312693498452\" data-width=\"646\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 646px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-506307\"><img alt=\"Lightning Powers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg 646w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Lightning Powers\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg 646w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lightning Powers</figcaption></figure><p>Lightning Lad has the ability to generate electricity and direct bolts of electricity accurately. Lightning Lad can use his power destructively, such as to short-circuit electrical items, split boulders, burn objects with precision or shatter walls. He can also reduce the force of his bolts so that they will only stun. He can send his electricity through conductive metals. He has a degree of immunity to electrical charge; in fact, they give him more strength to use his power. In some instances he has a robotic right arm that is powered by his lightning power.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Lightning Lad possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer\\'s willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Silver Age: Lightning Man</h3><p>In the original debut of the Legion of Supervillians, this team came from a time when the Legion of Superheroes had reach adulthood.

He appeared in every episode of season one and all but \"Cry Wolf\", \"Unnatural Alliances\", and \"Trials\" in season two.</p><p>In season one, Garth joined the Legion of Super-Villains to be with his brother Mekt and leave behind his immature Legion teammates but quickly learned the team wasn\\'t for him.
